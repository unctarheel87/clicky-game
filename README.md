# Simpsons Shuffle Game

## Concept
A 'memory' game where you must click on all 12 character images to win - You can't click on the same image more than once!

## Building Blocks
* UI is built with `React.js`
* `MaterialUI` for theming and styles, utilizing a `CSS in JSS` pattern
* Customer animations (the shuffle!) are implemented using `Lifecycle Methods` and `requestAnimationFrame`

 ## Hints
 * Win the game and enjoy the theme song!
